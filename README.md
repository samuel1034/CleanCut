## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
    cd <REPO_DIRECTORY>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
    ```
    You can obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows. You will need to open two separate terminal windows.

    - **Terminal 1: Start the Genkit flows:**
      ```bash
      npm run genkit:watch
      ```
      This starts the Genkit development server, making the AI flows available to your app.

    - **Terminal 2: Start the Next.js app:**
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
      This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:9002`.

Now you can open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application.
